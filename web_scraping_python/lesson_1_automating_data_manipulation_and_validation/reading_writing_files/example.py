#running a python file in a REPL versus the command line interface (CLI) are 2 different things.

#Command Line Interface (CLI):
#Purpose:
#A text-based interface to interact with an operating system or a specific program.
#Functionality:
#- Accepts commands and arguments to perform various operations.
#- Executes the entire command and provides output.
#- Does not typically provide an interactive loop like a REPL.
#Use cases:
#- Navigating the file system.
#- Launching programs.
#- Managing files and directories.
#- Executing scripts and automation tasks.

#Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop (REPL):
#Purpose:
#- An interactive environment to experiment with code, test snippets, and explore the language's features.
#Functionality:
#- Accepts single lines of Python code as input.
#- Evaluates the code immediately.
#- Prints the result or any error messages.
#- Loops back to the input prompt, allowing for continuous interaction.
#Use cases:
#- Learning Python syntax and built-in functions.
#- Debugging code by executing it line-by-line.
#- Quickly prototyping small pieces of code.
#- Interacting with objects and data structures in real-time.

#summary:
#Use REPL for experimenting and learning Python code interactively.
#Use CLI for performing tasks on the operating system or running Python scripts.
#Both involve interacting with a program via text commands
#REPL is more focused on coding language and small programs.
#REPL runs line by line not entire program filr at once.
#CLI is more focused on OS nd runs in terminal.
#Runs entire file by calling python3 "file name" in terminal.
print("hello world")
